### Problem #2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses


# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

To efficiently solve this problem, I employ a hash table to store the frequency of losses for each player. Using a for loop, I iterate over the input array and store that information. Then, I run another for loop over the hash table to identify players who havenâ€™t lost a single game and those who have lost only one game. Subsequently, I store these players in the answer array, sort each element of the answer array, and return the result.
