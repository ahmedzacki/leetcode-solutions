### Problem #268. Missing Number

# Time Complexity: O(n)

# Space Complexity: O(n)

To efficiently solve this problem, I used the set data structure. I created a set to store all the numbers from the input list called "nums". Then, I utilized a for loop to iterate over the range [0, n] and checked if every number in that range exists in our set. If it is not true for any number, then we have found our answer and that number will be returned.
