### Problem #92. Reverse Linked List II

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

To efficiently tackle this problem, I mastered pointer manipulation within linked lists. Initially, I introduced a dummy node to circumvent edge cases. These edge cases include scenarios such as when left == 1, indicating a reversal beginning from the very first node, or when the reversal starts beyond the first node. The dummy node effectively neutralizes these complications, allowing for a unified approach regardless of the starting position for reversal.

Next, I utilized a loop to pinpoint the commencement of the reversal section. Simultaneously, I employed an additional variable to keep track of the node immediately preceding the start node, which proved crucial for later steps. Following this, I initiated another loop, running for right - left + 1 iterations, within which I reversed the direction of each node's pointer to its predecessor. This process effectively reversed the designated segment of the linked list.

Upon completing the reversal, I focused on reestablishing connections within the list. This involved integrating the newly reversed segment back into the overall structure of the linked list. Finally, I returned dummy.next as the new head of the list, as the dummy node consistently points to the list's head, ensuring a smooth and efficient solution to the problem.
