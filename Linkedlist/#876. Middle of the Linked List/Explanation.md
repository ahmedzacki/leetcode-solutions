### Problem 876. Middle of the Linked List

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

To solve this problem efficiently, I utilized the fast and slow pointers technique. This involved using two pointers, each pointing to different nodes within the linked list. The fast pointer moved at twice the speed of the slow pointer. Consequently, by the time the fast pointer reached the end of the linked list or went out of bounds, the slow pointer was positioned at the middle node. I then simply returned the node indicated by the slow pointer.
