### Problem #844. Backspace String Compare

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

To address this problem efficiently, I employed the stack technique, complemented by a dedicated builder function designed to process each input string. This builder function accepts a string as its input and initializes a stack. It then iterates over the string, adding each character to the stack unless the character is a "#" symbol. Encountering a "#" indicates the need to delete the last character entered into the stack, which I achieve by popping the top element from the stack. Upon processing the entire input string, I convert the stack back into a string and return it. For the final comparison, I apply this process separately to two input strings and then compare their outcomes. If both processed strings match, it indicates that they are equivalent after accounting for the backspace ("#") operations.
