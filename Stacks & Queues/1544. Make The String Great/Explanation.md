### Problem #1544. Make The String Great

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

To solve this problem efficiently, I utilized the stack technique, aiming to identify adjacent pairs of characters. The process involves iterating over the input string with a for loop. At each iteration, I compare the current character with the one at the top of the stack to see if they are the same but in different cases (one uppercase, the other lowercase, or vice versa). If they match this criteria, it indicates a pair that needs to be removed; hence, I pop the top of the stack and skip adding the current character. If the condition is not met, I add the current character to the stack. In the end, the solution consists of joining the remaining elements in the stack to form the processed string. This method efficiently simplifies the string by removing adjacent character pairs differing only in their case.
