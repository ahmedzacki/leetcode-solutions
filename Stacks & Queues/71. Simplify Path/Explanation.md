### Problem #71. Simplify Path

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

To efficiently solve this problem, I employed the stack technique. The rationale behind using a stack is its suitability for managing path modifications, especially when encountering a component like "..", which indicates the need to navigate back to the previous directory or file. Thus, maintaining a record of previously visited directories is essential, and a stack provides a straightforward way to store the current directory path.

To address the challenge, I started by splitting the input string using "/" as a delimiter, recognizing that each slash signifies the start of a new directory name. This step produced an array of path components, over which I iterated using a for loop, assessing each element's significance.

For elements equal to "..", the operation required is to pop from the stack, effectively moving up one directory level. Components that are either an empty string, a space, or a single dot were ignored, as all these signify that the path remains within the current directory. Consequently, the remaining elements, which represent valid directory or file names, were added to the stack.

Finally, I utilized the join function to concatenate the elements in the stack with "/", forming the simplified canonical path. This resulting string was then returned, providing a succinct representation of the original path in its most reduced form.
